| R2 | Delay in dataset collection or preprocessing | Schedule | 3 | 3 | 9 | Mitigate |
| R3 | Team member becomes unavailable during model development | Schedule | 2 | 3 | 6 | Transfer |
| R4 | Need to purchase additional tools/software | Cost | 3 | 3 | 9 | Avoid |
| R5 | GPU/Hardware not available when needed | Resource | 3 | 4 | 12 | Mitigate |
| R6 | Insufficient storage for MRI dataset or model outputs | Resource | 2 | 3 | 6 | Mitigate |
| R7 | Stakeholders unclear about project goals | Stakeholder | 3 | 4 | 12 | Improve communication |


## Top Priority Risks (Mitigation Plans)
1. R1 – Model accuracy too low due to overfitting or poor generalization 
   - Mitigation: Use proper validation and tuning to prevent overfitting 
   - Owner: Liyana  
   - Deadline: 16 Dec

2. R7 – Stakeholders unclear about project goals 
   - Mitigation:   Conduct early alignment meetings and documenting clear objectives
   - Owner: Yazmin  
   - Deadline: 22 Dec

3. R5 – GPU/Hardware not available when needed 
   - Mitigation:  Schedule resources and prepare cloud-based/lower resource fallback options.
