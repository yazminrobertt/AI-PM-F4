1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?
Identifying the critical path is essential because it highlights the specific sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible duration for a project, allowing managers to prioritize resources and prevent any delays that would directly postpone the final completion date.

2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?
Every activity in this project poses an equal scheduling risk because they form a single, linear critical path with zero "float" or slack. Since each task is a direct predecessor for the next, any delay in an early stage like "Requirement Gathering" or a late stage like "Testing & Validation" will cause an immediate, day-for-day delay to the final completion date. While all are critical, Activity D (Model Training) and Activity H (Report & Presentation) represent the highest individual risks because their longer 6-day durations provide more opportunity for unforeseen technical issues to disrupt the entire timeline.

3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?
The primary trade-off in project crashing is the exchange of increased cost for decreased time, as managers spend more on overtime or additional labor to meet a deadline. This often results in a secondary trade-off where quality is sacrificed for speed, as compressed schedules increase the likelihood of errors, communication breakdowns, and team burnout. Additionally, crashing involves a resource trade-off, where accelerating one project may require pulling talent away from other internal initiatives, potentially solving one deadline crisis while inadvertently creating others across the organization.
