**QUALITY AND RISK IN SCHEDULE**

**GROUP: F4**




Requirement Gathering (6/10 - 8/10):

1**. QUALITY CHECK:** 

* Validate requirements with the users to ensure they are correct.
* Check for feasibility

2\. **RISK:**

* High-risk tasks identified 

&nbsp;						

Data Collection	(9/10 - 13/10):

**1. QUALITY CHECK:**

* The images must be clear and good quality.
* There should be enough images to train the CNN properly.
* The images must be correctly separated into folders						

Model Design (14/10 - 17/10):

1. **QUALITY CHECK:**

* The CNN architecture must be appropriate for image classification.
* The layers, activation functions, and parameters must be designed clearly and logically.
* The model should be able to learn without overfitting.

&nbsp;						

Model Training	(18/10 - 23/10):

1. **QUALITY CHECK:**

* The model must train without errors and converge properly.
* Overfitting or underfitting should be minimized.

&nbsp;					

Model Evaluation (24/10 - 26/10):

1. **QUALITY CHECK:**

* The model’s performance should be tested on unseen images.
* Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix should be used to assess quality.

**2. RISK:**

* High-risk tasks identified
