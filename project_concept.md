TITLE: 
Intelligent Brain Tumour Recognition System

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Brain tumour is a life threatening condition. Early and accurate detection is crucial for timely treatment. However, manual detection from MRI scans is time-consuming and prone to human error. This system aims to automate the detection and classifying process and provide a reliable second opinion to assist medical professionals.  

OBJECTIVE:
•	Develop an automated system that is capable of detecting brain tumour from MRI images
•	Can be used as a second opinion for professionals, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability.
•	To design a user-friendly interface that displays the classification results clearly for medical.

PROPOSED APPROACH:
Creating a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification. 

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
 A model capable of classifying brain images as tumour or non-tumour (with accuracy above 75%) through an easy and user-friendly interface. 

EVALUATION METRIC:
Confusion Matrix and F1-Score
