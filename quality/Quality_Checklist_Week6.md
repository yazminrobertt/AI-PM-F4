AI PROJECT MANAGEMENT WEEK 6

GROUP:F4



1. What must your AI system do to be considered successful?

**ANSWER:** The system must accurately classify the image as having a brain tumour or not.



2\. What will you measure to confirm the output is of acceptable quality?

**ANSWER:** We will measure accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and analyse the confusion matrix to ensure the CNN’s classification output is of acceptable quality



3\. What tools or processes will help you ensure quality?

ANSWER: We will perform data preprocessing, image augmentation, validation testing and hyperparameter tuning. Then, during this process, we will monitor the training using tools such as TensorBoard to ensure that the model is performing well.  



**QUALITY DEFINITION**



1. Accuracy Target:
   The model should have at least 92% accuracy rate
   
2. Performance Expectations:
   The system should give fast and accurate predictions, work correctly for different brain scan images, and avoid major errors like missing tumour cases.
   
3. User Interface: 
   Simple Python GUI where users can upload brain scan images. The interface will include an upload button and a display area to show the classification results.
   
4. Data quality requirements:
   Brain scan images that are properly organized into two folders: one containing images with tumours and another containing images without tumours, since we are using a CNN for classification.
