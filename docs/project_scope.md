**OBJECTIVE**

* Develop an automated system that is capable of detecting brain tumour from MRI images
* The system can be used as a second opinion for professionals, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability.
* To design a user-friendly interface that displays the classification results clearly for medical usage.



**DELIVERABLES**

* A CNN model that can properly classify whether an MRI image presented has a brain tumour or not.
* A simple and user-friendly Python-based GUI that allows users to upload an image and get the result of classification. 
* A written report explaining the system. The report should cover the project background, dataset description, methodology, steps taken, results and analysis.
