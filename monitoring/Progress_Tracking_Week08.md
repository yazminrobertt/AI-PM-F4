## Performance Analysis

1.	Which tasks show the largest deviation from plan?
ANSWER: Tasks that show largest deviation from plan is Report & Presentation which is 20% deviation, Testing & Validation with 10% deviation and Model Design with also 10% deviation.

2.	What are the possible causes?
ANSWER: The possible causes would be the dependencies on earlier technical tasks. It also can be the increased complexity in model development.

3.	Are the issues related to scope, cost, resources, or risks identified earlier?
ANSWER: The issues related to resource limitations and technical tasks like time constraints and unforeseen model challenges, rather than scope changes, though continued delays may indirectly impact project cost and schedule.
