### Proposed Corrective Actions

#### 1. Resource Reallocation
Additional resources, such as assigning more team members or increasing technical support, should be allocated to the **Report & Presentation** and **Testing & Validation** tasks. This helps address resource limitations and reduces delays caused by the increased complexity of model development and dependencies on earlier technical tasks.

#### 2. Schedule Adjustment
The project schedule should be revised by extending deadlines or resequencing tasks to better manage dependencies on earlier technical activities. This adjustment provides sufficient time for **Model Design**, **Testing & Validation**, and **Report & Presentation**, while minimizing the risk of further delays affecting the overall project timeline.
