1. **What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?
   Determining** 
   The most challenging part of building the schedule was determining the duration of each task. It was important to allocate enough time for completion and revision, without making it too long, as that would delay the entire project.
   
2. **How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration?**
GitHub allowed all team members to stay updated, as everyone could access the latest version of the project materials. Meanwhile, Teams supported our communication by keeping all discussions organized within the channel, allowing us to revisit them whenever needed.
   
3. **What tasks will you refine next week?**
   Next week, we will refine the project design and finalize the dataset selection and preprocessing steps to ensure the data is clean and ready for model training.
