Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
- I think doing report has the most subtasks out of the phases since we have to write about our project as detail as we can and the report is not that short so we would have to give each team member a part to write.

How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
- It makes large or complex goals easier to manage and track. When a big project is divided into smaller, specific tasks, it becomes clearer what needs to be done, when, and how

What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
- Review the progress of Model Training (Task 2.2):
    - Ensure Yazmin has all the required data and resources.
    - If training is taking longer than expected, consider extending the end date slightly or optimizing the workload.
