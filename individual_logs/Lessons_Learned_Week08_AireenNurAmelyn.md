Reflection Log 
Answer briefly:

1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?

The project schedule helped me the most because it allowed me to easily track task deadlines and see which tasks were on time or delayed.

2. What would you do differently in future projects?

In future projects, I would plan better time buffers for difficult tasks and check progress more frequently to avoid delays.
