1.	What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?

WBS. To have each task broke down in details makes planning more easier as we have set up our duration and goals.

2.	What would you do differently in future projects?
I would make sure to detect problems as early as I can. I would check if the teams involved communicate nicely with each other and I would make certain of the scope of the project.
