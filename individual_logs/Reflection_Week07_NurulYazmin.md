1\. How does effective communication reduce project risks?



Effective communication reduces project risks by ensuring that all stakeholders clearly understand the project goals, requirements, and limitations. Regular and clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings, identifies potential issues early and allows timely corrective actions. 

2\. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?



Radiologists are the most critical stakeholders because they directly interpret brain MRI scans and validate the model’s predictions. Their expertise ensures that the CNN model produces clinically meaningful and accurate results. Without their input and validation, the system may not be reliable or trusted for real-world medical use.
