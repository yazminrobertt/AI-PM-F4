**1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?**

Creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt chart was most helpful. Breaking tasks into smaller parts with assigned owners and timelines made it easier to track progress and identify delays.



**2. What would you do differently in future projects?**

In future projects, I would hold more frequent progress reviews and risk assessments to catch issues early. I would also improve resource allocation and communication to ensure tasks are completed more efficiently.
