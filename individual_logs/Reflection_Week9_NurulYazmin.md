1\. Identifying the critical path helps project managers know which activities directly affect the project completion time, so delays can be prevented and resources prioritized.



2\. The activity on the critical path with the longest duration posed the highest scheduling risk, since any delay would delay the entire project.



3\. Crashing a project involves trade-offs between reducing time and increasing costs, such as higher labor costs, resource strain, and potential quality risks.
